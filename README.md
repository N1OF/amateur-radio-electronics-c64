# Commodore 64 Programs for Amateur Radio &amp; Electronics
Programs (i.e. apps) from the book "Commodore 64 & 128 Programs for Amateur Radio & Electronics" by Joseph J. Carr:

Included is a script for Linux `mkd64.sh` that makes a d64 diskette image for C64 emulators or that could be written to a real diskette.
The d64 file can also be found among the releases.

Not all programs are included, but help is wanted to add more programs from the book. Test the programs before sending a pull request.
I usually find bugs in the programs that need to be fixed for them to run correctly. Sometimes the examples in the book are wrong. 
Add a comment when fixing bugs. Also comment if you discover code that can never run. I usually test using
the [Commander X16 emulator](https://www.commanderx16.com/) since it has CBM BASIC v2.
x16emu assumes the program is in upper case so only capital letters should be used in the submitted programs. Use Caps Lock or convert the file to upper case.
The programs here should be close to the originals.

The next step might be to convert the programs to TI-BASIC, Casio BASIC, or MicroPython so they could run on calculators. 
C64 programs can already run on Android phones using emulators e.g. [Frodo C64](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ab.c64)
or [Mobile C64](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.joergjahnke.c64.android).
